description         A library of general-purpose Objective C objects.
long_description \
    The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical \
    Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings, \
    object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations, \
    notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports, \
    remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops. \
    \
    It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical \
    portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).

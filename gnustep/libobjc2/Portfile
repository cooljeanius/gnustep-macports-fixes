# rationale for using clang:
# The default CC on 10.6/Xcode3 (gcc 4.2) seems to work, but
# the default CC on 10.6/Xcode4 (llvm-gcc 4.2) doesn't seem to support weak symbols.

description         The GNUstep Objective-C runtime
long_description \
    The GNUstep Objective-C runtime is designed as a drop-in replacement for the \
    GCC runtime.  It supports both a legacy and a modern ABI, allowing code \
    compiled with old versions of GCC to be supported without requiring \
    recompilation.  The modern ABI adds the following features: \
    \
    - Non-fragile instance variables. \
    - Protocol uniquing. \
    - Object planes support. \
    - Declared property introspection. \
    \
    Both ABIs support the following feature above and beyond the GCC runtime: \
    \
    - The modern Objective-C runtime APIs, introduced with OS X 10.5. \
    - Blocks (closures). \
    - Low memory profile for platforms where memory usage is more important than \
      speed. \
    - Synthesised property accessors. \
    - Efficient support for @synchronized() \
    - Type-dependent dispatch, eliminating stack corruption from mismatched \
      selectors. \
    - Support for the associated reference APIs introduced with Mac OS X 10.6. \
    - Support for the automatic reference counting APIs introduced with Mac OS X \
      10.7

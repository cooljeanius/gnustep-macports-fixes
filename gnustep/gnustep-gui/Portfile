    The GNUstep gui library is a library of graphical user interface classes \
    written completely in the Objective-C language. The classes are based \
    upon the OpenStep specification as release by NeXT Software, Inc.  These \
    classes include graphical objects such as buttons, text fields, popup \
    lists, browser lists, and windows. There are also many associated \
    classes for handling events, colors, fonts, pasteboards and images.
